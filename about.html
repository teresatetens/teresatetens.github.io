                    <h1>Hi! Thanks for visiting my blog.</h1>
                    <p>It was all meant to be. I haven't thought about that I would be learning something new at this phase of life. How myopic and closed I was. </p>
                    <p>Ever since my daughter came to me, my life has been changed. The more I endeavor to be a good mother and wife, the more I want and need to live as me for myself. I was looking for a way to find myself and to be myself.</p>
                    <p>On June 18th, 2020 I met my first 'Hello World!' via Kevin Powell on Scrimba, and I decided to learn to become a web developer.</p>
                    <p>Luckily enough, I've got a chance to join a coding bootcamp at WBS Coding School on August 31th, which makes me excited and nervous at the same time.</p>
                    <p>This blog is actually the final excercise of the prep course for the bootcamp and I learned a lot by watching the YOUTUBE tutorial of Jordan Hudgens.</p>
                    <p>I am writing this because I have no intention of plagiarising. If there is a related concern, please let me know. I will be showing how to build then, because I will keep learning by coding further.</p>
                    <p>You can find me also here:</p>
